Try using cursor
Prevent the command dialog from accepting negative slopes or take the absolute value of the slope and don't accept user parameters for the slope
Make sure the code is efficient enough to generate at least a 15x15 grid (but probably not more than 18x18 because of the vertical height that would require)
Create an elevator made entirely out of steel balls. Alternatively, create an automatic ball release similar to your clock's timekeeping
Add a ball to the 3D model
Add caching
Add user-editable parameters (ball_diam, clearance, slope). Make sure each track unit moves where it's supposed to whenever a parameter changes


Bonus:
Provide option to allow tunnels (no bends)
Clean up the path_generator code



If the ball gets stuck at the bend, consider adding a drop instead of increasing the angle
